# DDD-FastApi
The purpouse of this project is to try DDD - Domain Driven Design with using Python which we cant se often. My goals is to check how difficult will it be and also to learn how to create software in this methodology/philisophy. Project is minimalistic and often is not meeting real buissnes requirements - although its enough to catch how DDD works and map it on python language
